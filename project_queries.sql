-- Car Rental Data Analysis Project â€“ PostgreSQL Queries

-- This SQL file includes all queries used in the data analysis
-- for the car rental project inspired by Turo.
-- The goal of this project is to find valuable insights about
-- car performance, rental trends, pricing, and location popularity.

-- The queries cover:
-- 1. Basic Descriptive Statistics
-- 2. Average Daily Rate, Estimated Price, and the Ratio Between Them by Vehicle Type
-- 3. Vehicles with the Best Average Ratings
-- 4. Most popular vehicles considering number of reviews
-- 5. Most Profitable Vehicle Makes
-- 6. Highest Rental Potential Among Vehicle Types
-- 7. Locations by Highest Average Rating
-- 8. Most Renters Trips Vehicles

-- The database was normalized into 3 tables:
-- - locations
-- - vehicles
-- - rentals

-- Median calculations were used instead of average in many places
-- due to outliers in pricing data.

-- All queries were written and tested in PostgreSQL

-- Basic Descriptive Statistics

-- In this task, I wanted to understand how different car models perform
-- in terms of user rating, total trips taken, and number of reviews.
-- I grouped the data by vehicle make and model, then calculated the average rating,
-- average number of trips, and average review count for each group.
-- This gives a general overview of how popular and well-rated different car models are.

SELECT 

  vehicle_make,
  
  vehicle_model,
  
  ROUND(AVG(rating), 2) as avg_rating,
  
  ROUND(SUM(rentertripstaken) / COUNT(*)) as avg_trips,
  
  ROUND(AVG(reviewcount), 2) as avg_reviewcount

FROM rentals r

JOIN vehicles v

  ON v.vehicle_id = r.vehicle_id

GROUP BY vehicle_make, vehicle_model

ORDER BY avg_trips DESC, avg_rating DESC, avg_reviewcount DESC;



-- Average Daily Rate, Estimated Price, and the Ratio Between Them by Vehicle Type

-- In this task, I decided to use median values instead of averages,
-- because the dataset contains outliers, which was clear after checking the max and min values
-- of the estimated car prices.

  ROUND(PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY rate_daily)::NUMERIC, 2) AS median_daily_rate,

-- Vehicles with the Best Average Ratings

-- This task was focused on identifying vehicles with the highest overall rating.
-- To make the results more meaningful, I calculated a weighted score using both
-- the average rating and the total number of trips.
-- The idea was to combine customer satisfaction with vehicle usage to rank the top cars.
-- A vehicle with a good rating and many rentals is more trustworthy than one with just a few reviews.

SELECT

ORDER BY weighted_score DESC;


-- Most popular vehicles considering number of reviews

-- Here, I tried to find the most popular vehicles based on how many reviews they received.
-- More reviews often mean the vehicle is rented often and has wide user engagement.
-- I also included average rating to show whether popularity comes with customer satisfaction.
-- The result highlights the car models that are not only frequently rented but also well-reviewed.

SELECT 

  vehicle_make,
  
  vehicle_model,
  
  SUM(reviewcount) as sum_reviewcount,
  
  ROUND(AVG(rating), 2) as avg_rating

FROM rentals r

GROUP BY vehicle_make, vehicle_model

ORDER BY sum_reviewcount DESC;


-- Most Profitable Vehicle Makes

-- To solve this task, I also decided to use medians instead of averages,
-- because the dataset contains many outliers in the 'estimated_car_price' column.
-- This query calculates the median daily rate, median car price, and the ratio between them.
-- Finally, it also shows how many days a customer would need to recoup their investment 
-- for different vehicle makes.

SELECT 

  vehicle_make,
  
  ROUND(PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP(ORDER BY rate_daily)::numeric, 2) AS median_rate_daily,
  
  ROUND(PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY estimated_car_price)::numeric, 2) AS median_car_price,

ORDER BY rate_price_ratio DESC;


-- Highest Rental Potential Among Vehicle Types

-- In this task, I decided to find the vehicle types with the best rental potential,
-- based on the average number of rental trips and daily rates.
-- The logic is simple: the higher the number of trips and the daily rate, the better the rental potential.
-- So, I first calculated the average values of those columns by vehicle type,
-- then ranked them based on these values, and finally applied a scoring system
-- (60% weight for review count and 40% for daily rate)
-- to identify the top 5 vehicle types with the highest rental potential.

-- Locations by Highest Average Rating

-- This task focused on analyzing which cities had the highest-rated vehicles overall.
-- I grouped the data by city and used a weighted average formula based on rating and number of reviews,
-- to avoid giving too much value to vehicles with just a few reviews.
-- I also filtered out cities with fewer than 30 vehicles to make the results more reliable.
-- The final result shows which locations offer the best rental experiences.

-- Most Renters Trips Vehicles

-- The goal of this task was to find the vehicles with the highest number of total rental trips.
-- I summed the number of trips for each vehicle and sorted the results in descending order.
-- This allows us to see which exact cars (not just make or model) are the most rented ones.
-- It's useful for identifying high-demand vehicles that perform well in the rental market.
